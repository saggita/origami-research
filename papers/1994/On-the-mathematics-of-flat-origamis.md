#### Abstract
Origami is the art of folding pieces of paper into works of sculpture without
the aid of scissors or glue. Modern advancements in the complexity of origami
(e.g., the work of Montroll and Maekawa) reveal a rich geometric structure governing
the possibilities of paperfolding. In this paper we initiate a mathematical
study of this “origami geometry” and explore the possibilities of a graph theoretic
model. In particular, we study the properties of origami models which
fold flat (i.e., can be pressed in a book without crumpling). Necessary and
sufficient conditions are given for an origami model to locally fold flat, and the
problems encountered in trying to extend these results globally are discussed.
