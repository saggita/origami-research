### Abstract
Bi-directional search is a widely used strategy to increase the success and convergence rates of sampling-based motion planning algorithms. Yet, few results are available that merge both bi-directional search and asymptotic optimality into existing optimal planners, such as PRM*, RRT* and FMT*. The objective of this paper is to fill this gap. Specifically, this paper presents a bi-directional, sampling-based, asymptoticallyoptimal algorithm named Bi-directional FMT* (BFMT*) that extends the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm to bidirectional search while preserving its key properties, chiefly lazy search and asymptotic optimality through convergence in probability. BFMTâˆ— performs a two-source, lazy dynamic programming recursion over a set of randomly-drawn samples, correspondingly generating two search trees: one in cost-tocome space from the initial configuration and another in costto-go space from the goal configuration. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of BFMT* over its unidirectional counterpart, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art planners.

### Summary
Propose a bi-directional sampling based motion planning algorithm based on Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) and prove its asymptotically optimality.

### Pros
1. Much higher success rate compare to RRT*, PRM*.
2. Much faster especially in narrow passage and high dimentional space with large obstacle coverage.

### Cons
